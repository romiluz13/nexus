## 💡 Key Insights Extracted

### 1. **Granular > Monolithic** (wshobson)

**Pattern:**
```
❌ BAD: One mega-plugin with everything
nexus/
└── all-skills/ (20 skills, 3000 lines)

✅ GOOD: Focused plugins with clear boundaries
nexus/
├── feature-development/ (1-3 skills)
├── bug-fixing/ (1-2 skills)
├── code-quality/ (2-3 skills)
└── testing/ (2-3 skills)
```

**Why:** Token efficiency + composability + clear purpose

---

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure in 3 Tiers** (Anthropic)

**Pattern:**
```
Tier 1: Metadata (Always Loaded - ~100 words)
├── name: "Feature Builder"
├── description: "When to use this skill..."
└── allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit]

Tier 2: Core Instructions (Loaded When Activated - ~5k tokens)
├── SKILL.md body
├── Key workflows
└── Essential examples

Tier 3: Deep Resources (Loaded On Demand - unlimited)
├── references/complexity-scoring-guide.md
├── references/workflow-patterns.md
└── scripts/automation.py
```

**Why:** Only load what's needed when it's needed

---

### 3. **Multiple Skills Per Domain** (wshobson)

**Pattern:**
```
❌ BAD: One catch-all skill
python-development/
└── skills/
    └── python-expert/ (does everything)

✅ GOOD: Focused skills with clear triggers
python-development/
└── skills/
    ├── async-python-patterns/
    ├── python-testing-patterns/
    ├── python-packaging/
    ├── python-performance/
    └── uv-package-manager/
```

**Why:** More precise activation + better token efficiency

---

### 4. **Imperative Writing Style** (Anthropic)

**Pattern:**
```yaml
❌ BAD (Second Person):
"You should analyze the complexity..."
"If you need to refactor..."

✅ GOOD (Imperative/Infinitive):
"Analyze the complexity..."
"To refactor code, follow these steps..."
"When encountering errors, diagnose first..."
```

**Why:** Clearer for AI consumption, more professional

---

### 5. **Hybrid Model Orchestration** (wshobson)

**Pattern:**
```
Planning Phase (Sonnet 4.5):
├── Complexity analysis
├── Workflow selection
└── Architecture decisions

Execution Phase (Haiku 4.5):
├── File operations
├── Code generation
└── Test running

Review Phase (Sonnet 4.5):
├── Quality verification
├── Security checks
└── Final validation
```

**Why:** Cost optimization + performance balance

---

### 6. **Concise > Verbose** (ui-design example)

**Pattern:**
```yaml
❌ BAD: Over-explained (500 lines)
"When the user requests UI design, you should first
analyze their requirements by asking clarifying questions...
[400 more lines]"

✅ GOOD: Direct and clear (50 lines)
"Only code in HTML/Tailwind in single code block.
Start with response, then code, finish with response.
Design in style of Linear, Stripe, Vercel..."
```

**Why:** Token efficiency + faster activation

---

### 7. **Clear Activation Criteria** (All Sources)

**Pattern:**
```yaml
❌ BAD: Vague description
description: "Helps with coding tasks"

✅ GOOD: Specific triggers
description: |
  Builds features using adaptive workflows. Analyzes complexity
  (1-10 scale), selects optimal approach (Direct/Blueprint/Epic).
  Use when user mentions "add", "build", "create", "implement".
```

**Why:** Prevents skill collisions + better UX

---

### 8. **Documentation Structure** (wshobson)

**Pattern:**
```
docs/
├── README.md (Overview + Quick Start)
├── architecture.md (Design principles)
├── plugins.md (Complete catalog)
├── agents.md (Agent reference)
├── skills.md (Skills documentation)
└── usage.md (Commands + workflows)
```

**Why:** Users can find what they need fast

- [ ] Split 5 mega-skills into 12-15 focused skills
- [ ] Create plugin boundaries (feature-dev, bug-fixing, code-quality, docs)
- [ ] Move skills into appropriate plugins
- [ ] Add agents for hybrid orchestration

### Phase 2: Enhance Skills (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Rewrite in imperative form (remove "you")
- [ ] Shorten to 50-200 lines each
- [ ] Add clear activation criteria
- [ ] Create references/ for deep content

### Phase 3: Documentation (1-2 hours)

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Token Efficiency:**
```
Before (v0.2.0):
- 5 mega-skills: 8,500 tokens average
- All loaded when any triggered

After (v0.3.0):
- 12-15 focused skills: 3,000 tokens average
- Only relevant plugin loaded
- 65% additional reduction
```

### **User Experience:**
```
Before:
"Add a feature" → Feature Builder loads all workflows

After:
"Add a feature" → Only feature-development plugin
                → Only complexity-analyzer skill
                → 70% fewer tokens
```

### **Maintainability:**
```
Before:
- 5 files to manage
- Monolithic skills

After:
- Clear plugin boundaries
- Each skill 50-200 lines
- Easy to add/modify
```
