# Testing Methodology for NEXUS

This guide explains how to test the NEXUS Skills-First Architecture to ensure quality, harmonious orchestration, and zero conflicts.

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

**Skills-First Architecture requires skill-level testing:**
- Test individual skill activation
- Test skill orchestration (multiple skills working together)
- Test disambiguation (preventing conflicts)
- Test progressive disclosure (context efficiency)

---

## 🧪 Testing Levels

### Level 1: Skill Activation Testing

**Goal:** Verify each skill activates correctly on trigger keywords

**Process:**
1. Review skill's "When to Activate" section
2. Test each trigger keyword
3. Test disambiguation patterns
4. Verify skill doesn't activate on non-triggers

**Example Test Case:**
```markdown
Skill: complexity-analyzer

Test 1: Primary Triggers
- Input: "Add user authentication"
- Expected: Skill activates, analyzes complexity
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test 2: Disambiguation - "improve"
- Input: "Improve the login feature"
- Expected: Skill activates (feature enhancement)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test 3: Disambiguation - "improve code"
- Input: "Improve code quality in auth"
- Expected: Defer to code-smell-detector
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test 4: False Positive Prevention
- Input: "Fix the authentication bug"
- Expected: Defer to debugging-methodology
- Actual: [✅ Pass]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Activates on all trigger keywords
- ✅ Respects disambiguation rules
- ✅ No false positives
- ✅ No false negatives

---

### Level 2: Orchestration Testing

**Goal:** Verify skills coordinate correctly without conflicts

**Process:**
1. Identify common multi-skill scenarios
2. Test sequential activation
3. Test integration points
4. Verify no duplication

**Example Test Case:**
```markdown
Scenario: "Add authentication and improve code quality"

Expected Flow:
1. requirements-engineer → Asks clarifying questions
2. complexity-analyzer → Scores complexity (9/10)
3. workflow-orchestrator → Executes Epic workflow
4. code-smell-detector → Reviews quality
5. refactoring-patterns → Applies fixes if needed

Test:
- Input: "Add authentication and ensure good code quality"
- Expected: All 5 skills activate in order
- Actual: [✅ Pass - Sequential activation verified]
- Conflicts: [✅ None - Clear integration points]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Skills activate in correct order (priority levels)
- ✅ Integration points clear
- ✅ No skill duplication
- ✅ No conflicts

---

### Level 3: Disambiguation Testing

**Goal:** Verify ambiguous requests route to correct skill

**Process:**
1. Test all disambiguation patterns
2. Test edge cases
3. Verify conflict prevention

**Example Test Cases:**
```markdown
Ambiguous Request 1: "Fix the slow performance"

Test A: "Fix performance by optimizing code"
- Expected: refactoring-patterns (code optimization)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test B: "Fix performance by redesigning architecture"
- Expected: complexity-analyzer (architectural change)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test C: "Fix slow API response bug"
- Expected: debugging-methodology (bug fix)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Ambiguous Request 2: "Improve this"

Test A: "Improve this feature"
- Expected: complexity-analyzer (feature enhancement)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test B: "Improve this code"
- Expected: code-smell-detector (quality)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]

Test C: "Improve this broken login"
- Expected: debugging-methodology (bug)
- Actual: [✅ Pass]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Ambiguous requests route correctly
- ✅ Disambiguation patterns work
- ✅ No skill conflicts
- ✅ User intent respected

---

### Level 4: Context Efficiency Testing

**Goal:** Verify progressive disclosure works (only load what's needed)

**Process:**
1. Track context loading per request
2. Measure token usage
3. Verify references folder content loads only when needed

**Example Test:**
```markdown
Test: Simple request should load minimal context

Request: "Add logout button"
Expected Context:
- complexity-analyzer metadata (150 tokens)
- complexity-analyzer skill (1,500 tokens)
- CLAUDE.md (2,000 tokens)
Total: ~3,650 tokens

Actual: [✅ 3,712 tokens - Within target]

Request: Complex OAuth system
Expected Context:
- requirements-engineer full skill + references (8,000 tokens)
- complexity-analyzer full skill (2,000 tokens)
- workflow-orchestrator full skill (5,000 tokens)
Total: ~15,000 tokens

Actual: [✅ 14,892 tokens - Appropriate for complexity]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Simple requests use <5k tokens
- ✅ Complex requests scale appropriately
- ✅ References load only when needed
- ✅ No unnecessary context

## 🐛 Common Testing Issues

### Issue 1: Skill Doesn't Activate

**Symptoms:** Trigger keyword doesn't activate skill

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if keyword in skill's "When to Activate" section
2. Verify keyword isn't captured by disambiguation rule
3. Check if another skill has higher priority

**Fix:** Update trigger keywords or disambiguation patterns

---

### Issue 2: Multiple Skills Activate (Conflict)

**Symptoms:** Two skills try to handle same request

**Diagnosis:**
1. Review trigger keywords for overlap
2. Check disambiguation patterns
3. Verify priority levels

**Fix:** 
- Add disambiguation to one skill
- Clarify integration points
- Adjust priority levels

---

### Issue 3: Wrong Skill Activates

**Symptoms:** User wants skill A, skill B activates

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if request matches skill B's triggers
2. Review disambiguation patterns
3. Verify user request clarity

**Fix:**
- Improve disambiguation patterns
- Update skill descriptions
- Add examples to skill

## 📚 Advanced Testing Techniques

### Technique 1: Stress Testing Orchestration

Test 5+ skills activating together:

```markdown
Request: "Build auth, fix any bugs, improve code quality, add tests, document everything"

Expected:
1. requirements-engineer
2. complexity-analyzer
3. workflow-orchestrator
4. debugging-methodology (if bugs found)
5. code-smell-detector
6. refactoring-patterns
7. test-coverage-improver
8. api-documentation
9. architecture-documentation
10. code-comments

Result: All skills coordinate, no conflicts
```

### Technique 2: Disambiguation Edge Cases

Test borderline cases:

```markdown
"Fix this feature"
→ Is it broken (bug) or missing (feature)?
→ Test: Should ask clarifying question

"Improve authentication"
→ Feature enhancement or code quality?
→ Test: Should activate complexity-analyzer (feature context)

"Make API faster"
→ Optimize code or architectural change?
→ Test: Should clarify scope
```

### Technique 3: Token Budget Testing

Measure token usage for request types:

```markdown
Simple CRUD (logout button):
- Target: 3-5k tokens
- Actual: [measure]

Medium Feature (search API):
- Target: 8-12k tokens
- Actual: [measure]

Complex Feature (OAuth):
- Target: 15-20k tokens
- Actual: [measure]

All should be <50k (traditional plugin baseline)
```

## 🎓 Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Early, Test Often** - Test during skill development, not after
2. **Document Tests** - Include test results in PRs
3. **Test Real Scenarios** - Use realistic user requests, not synthetic
4. **Measure Everything** - Track activation accuracy, tokens, conflicts
5. **Automate When Possible** - Script repetitive tests
6. **Community Testing** - Encourage users to report misactivations
