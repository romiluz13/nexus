# Install all 4 plugins
/plugin install feature-development@nexus
/plugin install bug-fixing@nexus
/plugin install code-quality@nexus
/plugin install documentation@nexus
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úÖ Installed: feature-development@nexus
   Skills: complexity-analyzer, workflow-orchestrator, requirements-engineer
‚úÖ Installed: bug-fixing@nexus
   Skills: debugging-methodology, root-cause-analyzer
‚úÖ Installed: code-quality@nexus
   Skills: refactoring-patterns, code-smell-detector, test-coverage-improver
‚úÖ Installed: documentation@nexus
   Skills: api-documentation, architecture-documentation, code-comments
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# List installed plugins
/plugin list

# Should see:
# - feature-development@nexus (3 skills)

## üß™ Functional Tests

### Test 1: Orchestration Protocol

**Action**: Start any task
**Expected**: Claude should read CLAUDE.md automatically and follow orchestration protocol

**Test**:
```
User: "Build a simple REST API"
```

**Expected Claude Behavior**:
1. Checks orchestration protocol (mentions checking complexity)
2. Uses TodoWrite for planning (if complex enough)
3. Mentions checking if tasks can run in parallel
4. Follows decision tree logic

**Pass Criteria**: Claude mentions orchestration steps before implementing

---

### Test 2: Complexity Analysis

**Action**: Request a feature
**Expected**: complexity-analyzer skill activates

**Test**:
```
User: "Add user authentication with OAuth2"
```

**Expected Claude Behavior**:
1. Analyzes complexity using 5 dimensions
2. Provides score (0-10)
3. Recommends workflow (Direct/Blueprint/Epic)
4. Estimates time

**Pass Criteria**: Claude provides complexity breakdown with scores

---

### Test 3: Anti-Hallucination Validator

**Action**: Run the hallucination checker

**Test**:
```bash
# In your project
./scripts/hallucination-check.sh src/your-file.tsx
```

**Expected Output**:
```
üîç NEXUS Anti-Hallucination Validator v1.0.0
Checking: src/your-file.tsx

üì¶ Checking imports/requires...
  ‚úÖ react (exists in node_modules)
  ‚úÖ ./components/Header (file exists)

üìÅ Checking relative file paths...
  ‚úÖ ../utils/helpers.ts

‚úÖ PASS: No hallucinations detected!
```

**Pass Criteria**: Script runs without errors, validates imports

---

### Test 4: Progressive Disclosure

**Action**: Load detailed reference

**Test**:
```
User: "I need detailed complexity scoring criteria"
```

**Expected Claude Behavior**:
1. Mentions loading references/scoring-guide.md
2. Provides detailed criteria
3. Does NOT load all references upfront (token efficient)

**Pass Criteria**: Claude loads references on-demand, not all at once

---

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue 1: Marketplace 404

**Problem**: `/plugin marketplace add` fails with 404
**Cause**: GitHub file not found
**Fix**: Verify URL is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romiluz13/nexus/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

### Issue 2: Plugins Not Found

**Problem**: Plugins don't appear after marketplace add
**Cause**: Didn't restart Claude Code
**Fix**: Exit and restart Claude Code

### Issue 3: Scripts Not Executable

**Problem**: hallucination-check.sh permission denied
**Cause**: Scripts lose execute bit on Windows
**Fix**: `chmod +x scripts/hallucination-check.sh`

### Issue 4: Skills Don't Activate

**Problem**: Skills don't seem to work
**Cause**: Claude hasn't read CLAUDE.md yet
**Fix**: Explicitly mention task type (e.g., "Build feature X" triggers complexity-analyzer)
